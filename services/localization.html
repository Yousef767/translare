          The process of localization requires translation, adjusting code, error strings and messages, online help,
          end-user license agreements, legal requirements, technical specifications, and other assets like units of
          measurement, the formatting numbers, time, and dates, payment methods, and currencies all with cultural
          nuances in mind.

          There are approximately 7.8 billion people around the world, and 1.35 billion speak English. However, only
          about 360 million people speak English as their first language, meaning most of the world’s English-speaking
          population is more comfortable working with other languages. This applies to the Middle East and Africa
          region.
