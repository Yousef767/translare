      </h1>
      <article>
        <p>
          The message and impact of the original text should be retained in the marketing translation, but cultural
          aspects of the target market should be taken into account. Therefore, translating marketing texts requires not
          just the language but also cultural knowledge about the target countries.
        </p>

          We offer culturally adapted and SEO-optimized marketing translations by our creative linguists.

          <p>
            After the TEP process, we provide the Linguistic Quality Assurance process by which linguists review
            translations by using a set of methodologies to verify the precision of a translation for its cultural
            accuracy, linguistic phrasing, terminology, adherence to guidelines, formatting, and style to detect if they
            contain any objective errors and to assure adequate quality of the provided translation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The LQA team can meet any language in the Middle East & Africa and can meet any QA requirements of the
            client’s request.
