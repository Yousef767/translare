        Consecutive interpretation
      </h1>
      <article>
        <p>
          It is a mode of interpreting conducted in a two-stage process where one party speaks and pauses until the
          interpreter delivers the response to the other party. It’s typically utilized in one-on-one or small-group
          situations to enable people who speak two or more languages to communicate more effectively.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Normally ideal for </strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Small business meetings
          </li>
          <li>
            Client-attorney meetings
          </li>
          <li>
            Medical consultations
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>
      <h1>Simultaneous interpretation</h1>
      <article>

        <p>
          It takes place over the speech as it’s taking place, usually with a delay of 30 seconds or less.
        </p>
        <p>
          This type of interpretation is very challenging for the interpreter, who must be able to translate from one
          language into the target and convey that content to an audience while listening to a real-time speech.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Used at events where speakers’ responses are interpreted simultaneously
          </strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Conferences</li>
          <li>multilingual business meetings</li>
          <li>Events</li>
          <li>Tours</li>
        </ul>

      <h1>Over-the-phone interpretation</h1>
      <article>
        <p>
          Over-the-phone interpreting (OPI) service tends to be the most accessible option.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is essentially a 3-way conference call, where the interpreter facilitates the discussion between the two
          parties speaking different languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clients can receive either consecutive or simultaneous interpretations, depending on the project.

      <h1>Remote video interpretation</h1>
      <article>
        <p>
          Video Remote Interpretation (VRI) is the ideal format for professional real-time language access. VRI works by
          connecting an interpreter, who is typically at a call center equipped with a headset and video camera, with
          people who need assistance with communicating in various languages.
        </p>
