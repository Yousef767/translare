          Machine post-editing, is a hybrid translation service in which human linguists edit the output of advanced
          machine translation to refine the text and improve its quality. If your business is strategically aiming at
          using machine translation to save time and cost, you will need to upgrade the machine translation by using our
          MTPE service.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <strong>TRANSLARE</strong>, we make sure to edit the machine translation, make it error-free, resolve syntax issues, and
          refine the style to make it ready to reach your market in a cost-effective, and time-saving process.
        </p>
        <p>
          We provide both full post-editing to make all the needed edits to the MT, and light post-editing to make the
          MT text understandable and adhere to the client’s specific requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our MTPE team are professional translators, editors, and subject matter experts.

          Before ordering your MTPE request, you may like to know the difference between MTPE and human translation to
          choose the best fit for your objectives

        <h1>MTPE or Human Translation</h1>
        <article>
        <p>

          Technology improves every year and the quality of translation it offers is constantly rising which makes the
          debate around Machine translation vs Human translation is always controversial.
        </p>
        <p>

          As a matter of fact, Machine translation is cheaper, faster, and accessible. However, it has very low quality,
          unnatural sense, misconceptions, and potential errors that cost a lot.
        </p>
        <p>

          As for human translation, it is much more effective and accurate yet it costs a lot. So, combining both in
          MTPE is the optimum option for businesses who are looking for affordable translation solutions with higher
          quality and more accuracy than Machine translation.
        </p>
        <p>

          Nevertheless, MTPE and full human translation do have differences that you better consider before opting for
          what is best fit for your business.
        </p>
        <p><strong>We can summarize the differences between both in a matter of cons & pros as follows:</strong></p>
      </article>
      <h1>MTPE</h1>
      <article>

        <p><strong>Pros :</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Affordable price</li>
          <li>Higher quality than machine translation</li>
          <li>Higher clarity</li>
          <li>Improved flow</li>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>Cons :</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Slower than complete Machine Translation</li>
          <li>Potentially lower quality than full Human Translation</li>
          <li>The MT output may include bad and meaningless text that the translator cannot understand, leading to
            potential misunderstanding on the translator’s side, yet it was totally not their fault.</li>
          <li>Some linguistic nuances can be lost in the process.</li>
          <li>Inefficient for rare languages.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
      <h1>Human translation</h1>
      <article>
        <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Recognition of human aspects & cultural aspects in translation</li>
          <li>Convey deeper layers of meaning</li>
          <li>High quality</li>
          <li>Only human translators can deliver high-quality translations for complex subjects</li>
          <li>Translating any language pairs</li>

        <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
        <ul>
